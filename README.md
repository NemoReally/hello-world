Tutorial Repository
Seems Like I pressed the wrong button or didn't change something as my previous edit was committed to the Master branch, not to the readme-edits branch.
Here's the text I meant to be in the updated readme.md

Tutorial Repository Have a confusing list of programs in various languages gathered over some time. The problem is compounded by working on a Win10 laptop, an iMac 22" and a Linux (Debian) laptop (which is also infested with Windows Vista) ... oh, and a Raspberry Pi is waiting in the wings for some serious attention. It's now reached the point where I need to apply some serious version control to them so that I can retain some idea which is the actual working copy of some files that I use across different environments. For example, I'm playing around with a few Arduino scripts on all 3 PCs, which wouldn't be so bad if there were a convenient common storage system. I'll probably play around with a home file server at some point.
In the meantime, I think it might be beneficial to use GitHub as it is available via the web in all 3 systems. So ... here we go!
